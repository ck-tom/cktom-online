            <p>
                Hello! I'm CK-TOM, a software engineer with a passion for
                building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey began with a curiosity for how things work under the
                hood, leading me to explore various programming languages and
                technologies. I specialize in web development, but I also enjoy
                dabbling in systems programming and design.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me [insert hobbies here],
                reading tech blogs, or contributing to open source projects.
            </p>
