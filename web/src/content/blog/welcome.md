I've administered some websites over the course of my IT career, however this is the first time I'm doing one that isn't for a client. I didn't really feel like there was anything that I needed to put out on the internet so I just never did. I've historically tried to adhere to reletively conservative OpSec practices. While not perfect, I feel like I've done a respectable job keeping my online footprint minimal and obfuscated. \
\
I've also come to recognize that I do want to be able to share the things I do with people. As you might expect, the prospect of curating a social media persona is unappealing to me. Instead of a feed, I'm building this platform to showcase my work. Here you can find posts on thing's I'm doing, served statically and tracker-free.\
\
This site is my attempt to resolve that conflict. My *(admittedly ambitious)* goal is to build a Zero Trust architecture robust enough that I'm able to share everything with the community (except my secrets.yaml, of course) while keeping the infrastructure secure. \
\
Also using this as a project to practice using agentic coding tools. We'll see how it goes.\
