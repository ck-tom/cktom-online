# Welcome

```typescript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

While the internet has seen countless blogs, it has never before seen one created by me. I'll be using this to try to document stuff that I do which I find amusing.

I'm currently just trying to get the infrastructure for this website up and connected. I'm also using this project to test out Google AntiGravity.

I'm about 2-3 working hours into it now so hard to assess with such a small sample size. I will say that it would have probably taken me several days to get to this point on my own. I do not have any prior experience with Astro, nor Web Development in general.
